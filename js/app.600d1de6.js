I programmed the website using a front end framework called Vue. In Vue you can make various\n                        components that are kind of like custom made html tags. Your 'Vue App Instance' can pass data into these components in a top\n                        down manner, and the components can bubble information up to the main app by emitting custom events. I attempted to use all the\n                        basic functionality of vue, without getting too involved (I find front end web design frustrating and am not a huge fan). In vue, components\n                        have a template section, a script section, and a style section making it easy to make a components with lots of functionality in one file\n                        Components can have data, methods, properties which pass information from the parent to child component, and computed properties (for data that needs some math done beforehand).\n                        They can also emit custom events with an $emit method, which allows for data to bubble up to the parent instance. These custom events are then used like any other DOM event would.\n                        I attempted to use all of these in some way or form, even if it complicated things a rather than solve a specific problem.",link:"53kB0GKAd2k"},right:{text:"Since this is a static website, I used Netlify, which is a free service that allows you to link your github and host\n                        a static webpages.

There is also a feature which I call "infinite jump" which is definitely a feature\n                        and not a bug at all.
